The following link contains instructions on using excel spreadsheet as data along with JSON files (we can also use APIs once we figure out how to use them) [Read these instructions](./instructions.md).

To get started I wanted to meet up with everyone in a huddle and explain what I did so far. @Armando Pires found a website called Draftbit we can use to construct the application; @Alexander Gonzalez 10.3 found Taskade, an AI tool that can help us with planning/task managing /work flow. @Joram Mercado has a lot of background knowledge on Astrology that we can implement for the app. I also found a website where can access free data https://www.kaggle.com/datasets we can incorporate into the application. Here is more data we might be able to use https://www.astro.com/swisseph/swepha_e.htm it was recommended by users of this subreddit on this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/twe4bq/dataset_planets_and_houses/. Lmk what's a good time to get started so we can go over what @Armando Pires and I did so far and next steps ðŸ™Œ:skin-tone-5: (We didn't start anything regarding building the app; we mostly just set up this channel and consolidated resources).
